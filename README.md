# Unnamed-TD-game
A simple TD game written using C++ and SFML library

The game is basically finished, im plannning to make a new project again.

what's unfinished here is adding more towers, adding more enemies, and balancing the game and also menu which im too lazy to do now.

if you see lots of literal values in codes, i used them for testing only.




# Actions:

spawn enemies: space bar

build tower: click tower in the shop and click to where you want to build

you can click tower to toggle its radius

you can click tower and enemy to see its info.

# Configurations

you can edit the enemywave.txt to edit the waves of enemies with this format:

bandit

200

bandit 

500

one newline only. you can follow the format in the txt file there. 

it means it will respawn 200 bandits in first wave, with 1 second interval per spawn.
and 500 bandits in second wave, with 1 second interval per spawn

each wave has 5 seconds interval
