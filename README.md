# Unnamed-TD-game
A simple TD game written using C++ and SFML library

heres the link where you can download the game: http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/debug_23

The game is basically finished, im plannning to make a new project again.

what's unfinished here is adding more towers, adding more enemies (theres only 1 tower and 1 enemy type here) , enemy hp, tower damage, and balancing the game and also menu which im too lazy to do now.



if you see lots of literal values in codes, i used them for testing only.




# Actions:

spawn enemies: space bar

build tower: click tower in the shop and click to where you want to build

you can click tower to toggle its radius

you can click tower and enemy to see its info.

# Configurations

you can edit the enemywave.txt to edit the waves of enemies with this format:

bandit

200

bandit 

500

one newline only. you can follow the format in the txt file there. 

it means it will spawn 200 bandits in first wave and 500 bandits in second wave

each enemy will spawn with 1 second interval
each wave will start with 5 second interval

use "bandit" only because as i said earlier theres only 1 type of enemy here.
